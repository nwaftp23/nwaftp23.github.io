I’m a PhD student at McGill University, working under the supervision of [Professor David Meger](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=gFwEytkAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include Uncertainty Estimation, Normalizing Flows, and Diffusion Models.

Prior to joining McGill, I studied Mathematics with a specialization in Actuarial Sciences at Concordia University, where I was guided by [Professor Jose Garrido](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cYhIv9IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My Master’s thesis, titled [Hybrid Hidden Markov Model and Generalized Linear Model for Auto Insurance Premiums](https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/982074/), explored estimating a driver’s latent driving ability using standard insurance covariates to more accurately predict claims.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have co-founded two companies: Birds of Color Algorithms and Black Eagle Algorithms. Both of these focused on algorithmic trading in various domains, including Cryptocurrency, Stock Markets, and Sports Betting. I have also worked on an extensive list of machine learning projects outside of my PhD research, such as classifying CT scans for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, identifying fake news, developing Bayesian tools for phase 1 drug trials, detecting toxic text, and classifying videos as fake news.

In my spare time. I enjoy rock climbing, cycling, disc golf, spending time with my friends, cooking (but mostly eating the food I cook!) and board games.
