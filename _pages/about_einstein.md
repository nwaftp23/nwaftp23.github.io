I’m a PhD student at McGill University, working under the supervision of Professor David Meger. My research interests include Uncertainty Estimation, Normalizing Flows, and Diffusion Models.

Prior to joining McGill, I studied Mathematics with a specialization in Actuarial Sciences at Concordia University, where I was guided by Jose Garrido. My master’s thesis, titled "Hybrid Hidden Markov Model and Generalized Linear Model for Auto Insurance Premiums," explored estimating a driver’s hidden driving prowess using standard insurance covariates to more accurately predict claims.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have co-founded two companies, Birds of Color Algorithms and Black Eagle Algorithms, both of which focus on algorithmic trading in various domains, including Cryptocurrency, Stock Markets, and Sports Betting. I have also worked on an extensive list of machine learning projects during my time as a Research Assistant, such as classifying CT scans for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, identifying fake news, developing Bayesian tools for phase 1 drug trials, detecting toxic text, and classifying videos as fake news.

I am open to collaboration opportunities. If you’re interested in a research collaboration, please feel free to reach out via email.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
